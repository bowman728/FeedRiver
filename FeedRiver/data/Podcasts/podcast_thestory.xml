        &lt;p&gt;Ailyn Perez and Stephen Costello are
        husband-and-wife opera singers. They talk with Dick about the

        productions so that they can spend time together. Also in this show,
        wildlife photographer Tim Laman tells Dick about his journey to
        photograph every species of the Birds of Paradise. It took him 8 years
        and 18 expeditions to do it, and there are still a few he was not able
        to capture. The feathers and colors are hard to believe.&lt;/p&gt;

        attend tomorrow&#039;s Walmart shareholders meeting in Bentonville,
        Arkansas, where she will try to convince shareholders that Walmart must
        protect the safety of factory workers. Also in this show, an audio
        portrait of a Washington, D.C. bus driver, and a cardiologist who
        closes his office and enrolls in Divinity School. &lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Preventive Mastectomy: Two Women, Two Choices (6.4.2013)</title>
      <link>http://www.thestory.org/stories/preventive-mastectomy-two-women-two-choices-642013</link>
      <description>
        &lt;p&gt;When actress Angelina Jolie told the world she’d
        elected to have a preventative double mastectomy, people paid
        attention.  For Nell Boeschenstein, the news story felt personal. Nell
        also carries the BRCA-1 gene. After her aunt and sister developed
        breast cancer, Nell had a preventative double mastectomy at 31 years
        old. Also in this show, Dr. Daniela Drake, who was diagnosed with LCIS,
        was surprised when her doctor recommended a preventative mastectomy.
        She decided not to have the procedure.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Except when it isn&#039;t.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We
        check back in with Julia Trigg Crawford who is fighting the TransCanada
        Corporation as it lays pipe for the XL Pipeline. The digging has begun
        – in spite of ongoing litigation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also in this show,
        Sandra Steingraber was arrested on Earth Day, and spent 15 days in
        jail, for protesting against hydraulic fracturing (fracking).  After
        many years in laboratories, and speaking at panels, she felt the time
        had come to use her body in direct-action protest. &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;Rose Maura Lorre was kidnapped in 1982 in New
        Jersey. She was seven years old. While many kidnapping survivors aren
        &#039;t able to tell their stories, Rose says she told her story a lot.
        Too much, she says. Also in this show, an audio portrait from Moore,
        OK, where a tornado tore through town killing 24 people. And, a
        sculptor recreates Rome’s Trevi Fountain…in cardboard. &lt;/p&gt;

      <link>http://www.thestory.org/stories/maxed-out-everest-5302013</link>
      <description>
        &lt;p&gt;Hundreds of people are now attempting to climb Mt.
        Everest every year. National Geographic&#039;s Mark Jenkins says the
        mountain, once tackled only by professional climbers, has become
        accessible to anyone who can afford to pay to go up and down.  And as a
        result, the mountain is being ruined by garbage, human excrement, and
        even bodies of deceased climbers. Also in this show, we learn about a
        new kind of aircraft, the “Aeroscraft.&quot;  It’s a space-age looking
        machine that’s almost as big as a football field and able to carry 50
        tons or more.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Journey From North Korea (5.29.2013)</title>
      <link>http://www.thestory.org/stories/journey-north-korea-5292013</link>
      <description>
        &lt;p&gt;On today’s show we meet a woman who fled North
        Korea for China, only to be abducted by human traffickers and sold into
        a marriage. Next, Dick talks with filmmaker Ann Shin, who tells us that
        it’s not uncommon for defectors to escape North Korea for China and
        find themselves in greater danger.  Ann Shin’s documentary, &lt;em&gt;
        The Defector&lt;/em&gt;, follows women as they escape. Also in this
        show, a photographer documents the edges of the country – where North
        Korea borders South Korea and China. &lt;/p&gt;

      <description>
        &lt;p&gt;Over the course of 13 years, Joe Brewster and
        Michele Stephenson filmed their son’s progress through the elite New
        York City prep school called Dalton. As an African-American family in a
        predominantly white school, the years were challenging for everyone, as
        seen in the family’s documentary &lt;em&gt;American Promise&lt;/em&gt;.
        &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also: Comedian Alaudin Ullah’s parents are Bengali,
        and were among the many East Indian and Bangladeshi immigrants who
        moved to New York at the turn of the 20th century. Alaudin has been
        exploring the lost history of his old neighborhood, often called
        “Bengali Harlem.” &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;We hear two dispatches from US Military base Camp
        Buehring. Chaplain Matt Stewart describes a wall of photographs of
        fallen soldiers, and tank mechanic Sgt. Roberto Abelardo, who witnessed
        the Twin Towers falling on 9-11 and decided to enlist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p
        &gt;Also: William B.J. Ganem knows what it’s like to lose a limb. For
        him, it happened in Iraq. He’s currently working to support victims of
        the Boston bombing in their recoveries through the Semper Fi Fund. And:
        Dick talks to Anna Diebold about her father’s memoirs of rescuing
        downed pilots in Burma during World War II.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;The Story has followed the life of a school teacher
        from Somalia since 2009. Earlier this month, he found out that he won a
        visa lottery to the U.S. Also in this show: Philanthropist Melinda
        Gates has had conversations with mothers across the globe, and says
        women everywhere want to find the best care for their children. For
        years, dozens of runners dropped their gear at Boston’s Crossroads
        Irish Bar, took the subway out of town, and ran the Boston Marathon
        route back to the bar. And Bob Stewart, who owned Carousel Arcade in
        Seaside Heights, N.J., says the town is as ready as it can be for the
        summer season.&lt;/p&gt;
